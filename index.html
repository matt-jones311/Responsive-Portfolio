      <img src="images/Mpic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Matt Jones">

      <p>I am a Full Stack Web Developer who is currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. I have always had a passion for building and designing things as well as problem solving. I have always had an interest in technology and have found a way to explore that interest through web development.

        I am familiar with the core languages in front-end development (HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) as well as backend (mySQL, noSQL, Node.js, Express)
        
        I would love to break into the world of designing mobile apps. There are many apps out there already but I believe that it is possible to improve what we already have and come up with new apps that can make life even better.
        
        
        Being passionate about music, my experience as a musician makes me a creative thinker; just as there is no one way to write a song, there is no one way to to write code.</p>
